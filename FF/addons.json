Of course not! It has been reborn!

Just right-click on the page you want to grab and look in the \"Screengrab\" menu.\nIt will capture what you can see in the window, the entire page, just a selection, a particular frame... basically it saves webpages as images - either to a file, or to the clipboard, or upload to internet.\n\nThe following little keywords are at the request of those who can't remember the name ScreenGrab and want searches to work. It takes screen shots, screenshots, capture, screen capture, - that is, shots (captures), of web pages.","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/141/141834.png?src=api&modified=1408633088","width":"529","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/141/141834.png?src=api&modified=1408633088","thumbnailWidth":"151","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Screengrab!"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/141/141822.png?src=api&modified=1408633088","width":"592","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/141/141822.png?src=api&modified=1408633088","thumbnailWidth":"169","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Settings - Image name"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/141/141824.png?src=api&modified=1408633088","width":"592","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/141/141824.png?src=api&modified=1408633088","thumbnailWidth":"169","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Settings - Save"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/141/141826.png?src=api&modified=1408633089","width":"592","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/141/141826.png?src=api&modified=1408633089","thumbnailWidth":"169","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Settings - Upload"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/141/141836.png?src=api&modified=1408633089","width":"490","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/141/141836.png?src=api&modified=1408633089","thumbnailWidth":"140","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Screengrab upload to s3blog.org"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/141/141828.png?src=api&modified=1408633089","width":"592","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/141/141828.png?src=api&modified=1408633089","thumbnailWidth":"169","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Settings - Notifications"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/141/141830.png?src=api&modified=1408633089","width":"592","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/141/141830.png?src=api&modified=1408633089","thumbnailWidth":"169","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Settings - Image"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/141/141832.png?src=api&modified=1408633089","width":"592","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/141/141832.png?src=api&modified=1408633089","thumbnailWidth":"169","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Settings - Actions"}],"averageRating":5,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/screengrab-fix-version/?src=api","homepageURL":"http://www.s3blog.org/screengrab.html","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/273366/screengrab_fix_version-0.98.01c-fx+sm.xpi?src=api","size":97020,"contributionURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/screengrab-fix-version/developers?src=api","contributionAmount":"$10.00","developerComments":null,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/screengrab-fix-version/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":172,"totalDownloads":1064533,"weeklyDownloads":10540,"dailyUsers":151931,"updateDate":1409138105000,"supportURL":null}]}
